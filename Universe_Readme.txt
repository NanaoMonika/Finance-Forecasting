This document is for Universe Modeling project sponsored by Principal Finance Group.

All of notebooks uses Python 3.5

------- PreProcessing---------

Asset_Clusterization: This script is initial exploration of problem. Various dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE are being used. Also, k-means clustering has been implemented.

Corr_principle: This script has correlation analysis with different thresholds.

Data_Preprocessing: This script deals with data preprocessing. 


---------- Genetic Algorithm---------

GA_without_tpot_100_100: Genetic Algorithm


------- Regression--------------

Principal-Finace-Feature Lag-New: This script went wrong because we lagged target variable but important takeaway is future prices are one of most important indicator.

Principal_Modelling-OriginalFeatures: This script is based on 18 features with different modeling techniques

Principal_Modelling-DerivedFeatures: This is all with time variant features.

Principal_Latest: This is the final script with different experiments. Also, includes model investigation.
